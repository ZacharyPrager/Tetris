Re-created my favorite game since the website I used to play it on shut down :(

# Learning
The main thing I learned was how to do OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). I’ve always had trouble finishing projects, and I think the root of that problem was my lack of structure and organization. I mostly taught myself how to code, so I was never really taught how to structure a project—until now.

My main focus was making the code so organized that I couldn’t mess things up (lol). I didn’t just copy and paste—I thought through every single function and fully understood how it works, and why it was written that way. One of the coolest things I learned was inheritance using .super(). I used it to make different Tetris pieces that all share the same base behavior from the main piece class.

I also added some extra features like score tracking, a level system, and increasing speed as the game progresses. I plan to add a ghost piece that shows where the block will land using self.ghost, and eventually improve the UI and add a hold piece feature.

Overall, this was a great stepping stone. It taught me real structure, and now I feel like I can finally make full projects on my own without needing a tutorial.
