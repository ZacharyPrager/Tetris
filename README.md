Re-created my favorite game from scratch after the original website I used to play on shut down 😢

🎮 Features I Added
✅ Score tracking

✅ Level system (with increasing speed)

✅ Hard drop (instant fall)

🔜 Coming soon: ghost piece (visual indicator for drop position)

🔜 Coming soon: hold piece (swap a piece out and save for later)

🧠 What I Learned
This wasn’t just a copy-paste tutorial — it was a deep dive into understanding how to actually build a game. Before this, I struggled with project structure and object-oriented programming (OOP), which held me back from completing real projects on my own.

While building this, I learned to:

Design classes and manage game state cleanly

Use super() to efficiently inherit common behavior across different Tetris piece classes

Write modular, reusable code instead of a big block of functions

Think through how timers and events work in game loops (like pygame.USEREVENT for auto-dropping pieces)

I didn’t just follow instructions — I internalized the logic and then added my own features from scratch.

🌱 Why This Project Matters
This was a turning point in my programming journey.
It’s the first project where I finally felt OOP click. I now feel confident building structured programs and pushing through full projects — something I couldn’t say before.

Before, I was just trying to “understand” concepts. Now I apply them.
